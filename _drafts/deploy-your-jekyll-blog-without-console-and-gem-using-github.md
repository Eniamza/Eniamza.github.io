## Deploy your jekyll blog without Console and GEM using GitHub
----------------------------

### The Scenario 

---------------

Now a days blogging has become a part of online identity. When I name it the first thing comes to my mind is **Jekyll** . An industry standard static site generator. As static sites are more faster than others because it doesn't needs to dynamically generate pages as clicked. But starting with a jekyll blog might be a pain. As it needs you to serve it using gem and *karen* doesn't want to write in console.  \

And GitHub comes to rescue. GitHub has a ~~nice~~ > Great feature for jekyll blog deployment without jumping in pain. \

--------

### The Solution

--------

As I said \

> There is always a workaround \

And for that you have to head to my content on [LBRY](https://lbry.tv/@Enilog:f/Deploy-your-first-jekyll-blog-without-GEM-and-console:0) . \

### More resources

-------------

After deploying the blog you can edit your `_config.yml` to choose from vast libraries of theme. \

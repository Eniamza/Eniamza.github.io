## Trace users on about 300 social medias with SHERLOCK

***

### The scenario

***

Karen had an email from an unknown address. The sender told to follow “Neo” on Twitter to get 20k LBC for free. But he decided to check on that username.... 🧐

### The solution

We can call Sherlock Holmes 🕵️‍♀️ . But sadly he doesn’t exist in real. But a project called `Sherlock` has the power to do this. <br>
So let’s start - 🥳 <br>

* Install python3.6 - `sudo apt install python3.6 python3-pip`
* As always - `git clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git`
* Change directory-  `cd sherlock`
* Run installation-  `sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run -  `python3 sherlock --help` for command list

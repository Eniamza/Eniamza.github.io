### The Myth
---------
For years the word **DarkWeb** has been surprisingly a matter of fear. When someone says *DarkWeb*, <br> <br>

 an image of horrific doll or a _dali-masked hacker_ appears in front of our eyes. As if we enter the dark web some *half-dead* zombie will appear in our room and eat us. <br>
And the terror of Being hacked. Like a brilliant hacker is waiting at the door of the web for us. As soon as we enter, our whole past and future will be in his hand. <br>
The question is **Do they exist?**

-------
### The Dark Side 
----
- **<u>Zombies</u>** <br>
NO. There aren’t any zombies. Neither in real world. But yes there are people who are zombie minded. Sounds joke?  <br>
The darkweb is called dark for this reason. Because there are some people who really likes to do bizzare things. Like killing brutally, selling child porn and gore. Torturing for money etc. Dark? <br>

- **<u>Hackers</u>** <br>
In 2020 century it’s nearly impossible for someone to hack like the myth. But again they can be harmful. As a proverb goes <br>
> <u>There’s no patch to humanism</u> <br>

Browse with a leaky system/browser, give email, phone, credit card information, click on malware-injected links **ignoring AV warnings**, it’s enough for even a noob to make your life hell. Dark? 
- **<u>The Other</u>** <br>
Drugs, guns, child porn, Loli, gore, rape, torture, redrooms, hellrooms, Domination etc etc etc.. are often too much for someone to handle. If you are weak-hearted it's better to stay away from these
-------
### The Brighter Side
-------

Well it may be unbelievable but Darkweb is greatly used for brighter things to. Like <br>
- **<u>WhistleBlowing</u>** <br>
There are groups (_wikileaks,anonymous_) and peoples (_Edward snowden_) who are not fine with the system. Their eyes  have seen things that is not appropiate for the general mass. So they come to darkweb to be ghost in naked eyes and expose the internal affairs to stop them (_Often by making a mass movement_) <br>
- **<u>Journalism</u>** <br>
Sadly , Most of the countries filters their media and news to cover their private ,often dirty works. As DarkWeb is not censored at all and people become mostly anonymous , they can publish news freely in their forums or their websites. <br>
- **<u>Communication</u>** <br>
Mass surveillance have been there for intercepting our private life as well as virtual life for advertising and tracking. Darkweb allows one to connect with others without getting himself in front of others. <br>
- **<u>Forbidden Knowledge</u>** <br> 
If you have ever searched _How to hack_ , the search results are always rounded up and filtered . The shown outputs are nothing but some premade useless scripts. But here nothing is filtered and you are free to find your desires

### Access The Dark Web
---
People often mistakes by thinking that Tor is the dark web where tor is only a gateway which allows you to securely connect to the internet using a `relayed network` for anonymous connection. <br>
DarkWeb is just another network of sites which can only be accessed with special kind of gateway. So **Tor is not the DarkWeb** .

---
### So what is TOR ?
---
The name **Tor** is the shortform of the project name called **The Onion Router** . Tor is a gateway which is run by volunteers around the world. Each volunteer sets up a `Tor Node` on their computer . When a Tor client (_e.g. karen's computer_) wants to access the internet over tor, the connection is routed through 3 computers which can be located in anywhere in the world. In this way Tor represents your computer as anonymous and if used correctly it's almost impossible to differenciate between you and your **Cat** .  <br>

### Is it illegal ?
---
Illegality or potential takedowns by law-enforcements are not an option in darkweb. Here you are responsible for everything you do. <br>
If you are into whistleblowing against your government's internal affairs then it's depended on your local law. If you're buying drugs or guns or into redrooms (_Torture cells_) ,then Yes you may get in trouble if you are traced back. <br>
But if you're just browsing and watching silently , then it's not illegal until **streaming** is also filtered by law in your area <br>
In hidden wikis and forums, asking _How to feed cats_ or _How to hack wifi_ won't get you in trouble that much. But _Hiring an contract killer for president_ will surely get some knocks at the door <br>
In the end, You need to save your own ass in Darkweb or there is always someone ready to burn it.

------------
 ### Enticed ?
-----------
If you feel attracted to be on the darkweb, well **Welcome** .
But remember <br>
> <u>There is no unmixed Good</u> <br>

Here you are on your own. Your choices, Your consequences.

### Turn your Android into a hacking device **Without Root**

-------------

### The Scenario

------------------------

Karen saw a movie yesterday named [Snowden](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3774114/) . It awake his inner hacker. He was desparately searching for hacking methods but he found that [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is the least requirement for hacking which requires a PC . But he is a windows user and he fears dual booting. Also He has only 3GB of RAM in his Laptop so VM (Virtual Machines) will be slowish for him. But he has a android phone with 6GB RAM but **Not Rooted** . He knows <br>

<u>There is always a workaround</u>

----------------------------

### The solution

-------------------------

The dream of every script kiddies are almost the same. One click Hacking with their android phone there is a application called *Termux* which requires root for most works because hacking scripts requires system calls and access to a root filesystem. Which can only be achieved by root. But <br>

**UserLAnd** to the rescue. It adapted a brilliant (Almost) technology called *PRoot* . Which runs in the background to make these system calls . Also it creates a virtual File system which *Of course* has root access to itself. <br>

So Let's start our Installation :- <br>

- First . Dude.. It's Android and we need app. So .... [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/app/tech.ula) or [APK](https://github.com/CypherpunkArmory/UserLAnd/releases/latest) 
- Install the app.
- Accept whatever it asks..
- You will be presented with a list of different linux distributions and some other browsers and Graphical Tool
- As we want to be Hacker we need **Kali** . Yes **Kali in Android** . Tap on the kali dist.
- Now you will have 3 options. Forget others SSH (Secured Shell) is the most efficient one. VNC(Basically a localhosted GUI Interface) is good too but... SSH for now
- In here you will need to setup your credentials. **Remember to take a note**
- The rest will be done automatically . <br>

And **Voila** you have successfully installed Kali in your android . You will have in-app filesystem and of course root permissions to perform all task. 

--------------------------

### Limitations 

-----------------------

Again it does not have actual root access so you can't set your device's wifi adapter to Monitor Mode. Chances are your hardware also will not support that. 

------------------------

### Lesson

------------------------

Copy-pasting random commands and using ready-made scripts will not make you a hacker

## Setting Up Hacking Environment [Installing Kali]

-------------------------------

### The scenario

------------------

Karen wants to be serious in his hacking carrier. But he is totally newbie. After searching for 30 Seconds he saw that **Kali Linux** is the paradise of hackers . But as always he is afraid of Dual Booting as well as Messing with System partition or a live boot.

-----------------------------------

### The Solution

--------

The concept of virtual machine is always green. You can run any. Yes nearly *ANY* Operating System through virtual machine. For example Bluestacks or Nox Player (Known as android emulators) are also a kind of virtual machine. Though they are used for single purpose. <br>

**Virtual Box** is a multi-purpose VM . Probably the most flexible and free. And easy to adapt. So let's start Karen.. <br>

Heyy karen .. No no that's CD not a frisbee <br>

- Download the package suitable for your OS from [Here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
- Download your desired ISO. I'll Use Kali's ready to use .vmdk image. [32 Bit](https://images.offensive-security.com/virtual-images/kali-linux-2020.2-vmware-i386.7z) or [64 Bit](https://images.offensive-security.com/virtual-images/kali-linux-2020.2-vmware-amd64.7z) 
- Install and accept if it promotes for other drivers
- Click add > choose the vmdk file > Set up ram and whatever you want to modify.
- Keep RAM allocation below 50% or you'll regret later. (Though you can always change)
- And **Voila** You've successfully setup your hacking machine.

### The Post process

----------------------

Select that VM you just created >> Click Start >> **BOOM!** <br>

The default username and password will be `root`

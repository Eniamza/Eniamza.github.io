This is the first post ever published in here.

The journey started towards an unknown blackhole. No one knows what will happen .Assumptions are forbidden. All prediction falls .But it will go on.

Towards the darkness. Slowly.

There will always be someone. Somewhere . Under the darkest shadow. There will be light. perhaps the brightest ones. But the brighter it becomes the darker the shadow gets.

No one expects the dark. But it is there. Pulling all the lights in it.

   < Darkness is the symbol of power.
     Because it hardens it's existence
     by devouring light />

A necessary evil. The balance of nature. Perhaps for the dirty games.

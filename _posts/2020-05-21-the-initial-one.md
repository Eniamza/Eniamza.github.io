This is the first post ever published in here.<br> 

The journey started towards an unknown blackhole. No one knows what will happen .Assumptions are forbidden. All prediction falls .But it will go on. <br>


Towards the darkness. Slowly. <br>


There will always be someone. Somewhere . Under the darkest shadow. There will be light. perhaps the brightest ones. But the brighter it becomes the darker the shadow gets. <br>


No one expects the dark. But it is there. Pulling all the lights in it. <br>


    Darkness is the symbol of power.
     Because it hardens it's existence
     by devouring light />
<br>

A necessary evil. The balance of nature. Perhaps for the dirty games.
